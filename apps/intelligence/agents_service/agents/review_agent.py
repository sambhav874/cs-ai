Review Agent v3 — Phase 2.2
3-step pipeline:
  Step 1 — Extract Agent (Haiku/fast): segment + extract fields + custom fields + open-ended
  Step 2 — Validate Agent (Sonnet): cross-check values, normalise types, flag confidence
  Step 3 — Score & Classify Agent (Sonnet): risk score, contract type, summary

Changes from v2:
  - Chunked extraction for long docs (40K chars, 4K overlap, merge logic)
  - Dynamic custom field injection into extract prompt
  - Open-ended "extract anything else relevant" section
  - contract_type context injected for re-type flows

  unfavorable — burdens the uploading party: uncapped liability, broad indemnity, one-sided IP assignment, auto-renewal with short opt-out, short cure periods
  neutral     — standard boilerplate with balanced obligations
  unusual     — non-standard, unexpected, or bespoke clause for this contract type

IMPORTANT: Extract ALL significant clauses — do not limit to one per type. A contract may have multiple termination provisions (for cause, for convenience), multiple payment clauses, etc. Extract each as a separate entry.

}

─── How to classify contractType ────────────────────────────────────────
Pick the MOST SPECIFIC type that fits. "OTHER" is a last resort — only use
it when none of the specific types apply. Look at the contract's PURPOSE,
not just its title. Use this decision tree:

NDA              — Purpose is SOLELY confidentiality obligations between parties
                   before/around a potential deal. No commercial exchange or
                   service delivery. Typical fields: term, mutual/unilateral,
                   permitted use, liquidated damages.

MSA              — A FRAMEWORK agreement. Governs multiple future engagements
                   (SOWs/Orders). Has general T&Cs (IP, liability, confidentiality,
                   termination, insurance) but no specific deliverables or
                   project scope. Title often includes "Master" / "Framework" /
                   "Master Services Agreement". Prefer MSA over OTHER when the
                   body clearly talks about "SOWs", "change orders", "future
                   engagements", or sets up rules for multiple projects.

SOW              — Tied to a SPECIFIC project with milestones, deliverables,
                   and a fixed fee or T&M cap. Often references a parent MSA.
                   Has dates, phases, named team. Treat multi-milestone
                   consulting engagements as SOW even when labelled
                   "Consulting Agreement" if milestones + deliverables exist.

SLA              — Service levels: uptime % + response/resolution times +
                   service credits. Usually attached to an MSA or Order Form.

VENDOR_AGREEMENT — Ongoing vendor-provided services with a subscription /
                   monthly fee and no specific project (cloud hosting, managed
                   services, data feeds). Different from MSA in that it's
                   SINGLE-SCOPE — there's one thing being delivered
                   repeatedly, not a framework for future projects.

EMPLOYMENT       — Individual PERSON as one party; includes base salary,
                   benefits, role description, at-will/termination terms.

PARTNERSHIP      — Two organizations jointly pursuing a venture: revenue share,
                   joint product development, co-marketing, exclusivity.
                   Prefer PARTNERSHIP over OTHER when there's an explicit
                   "Partners" relationship + mutual contributions.

LICENSE          — Grants usage rights to software, content, or IP in
                   exchange for fees. Has usage restrictions, reverse-
                   engineering prohibition, license scope (users / seats).

DATA_PROCESSING  — A DPA supplementing another agreement. Governs Controller/
                   Processor handling of personal data (GDPR/CCPA). References
                   SCCs, breach notification, sub-processors.

ORDER_FORM       — A specific subscription purchase under a master. Has seat
                   counts, term, total contract value, start/end dates. Often
                   references a governing MSA/MSSA.

OTHER            — Only when NO specific type fits. Examples: amendments (rare
                   — classify under the underlying agreement if clear),
                   settlement agreements, letters of intent, term sheets.

─── Risk factors ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Risk factors to consider: unlimited liability, no liability cap, broad
indemnification, IP assignment to counterparty, auto-renewal with short
opt-out window, long notice period, no audit rights, restrictive assignment,
MFN obligations.
