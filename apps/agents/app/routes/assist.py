Variant spec:
 • "least"      — minimal edits; preserves the counterparty's language \
wherever safe. Typical use: deal is strategic, legal is compromising.
 • "moderate"   — balanced rewrite; our playbook's "acceptable" position. \
Typical use: standard negotiation.
 • "aggressive" — full rewrite to our playbook's "preferred" position. \
Typical use: high-value deal or we have leverage.

Rules:
 • CARRY THE PLAYBOOK'S NUMBERS THROUGH EXACTLY. Where a position states a \
figure — a multiplier, a cap, a notice period, a percentage, a duration — the \
variant targeting that position MUST use that same figure. A cap of a \
different size is not a softer version of the position, it is a DIFFERENT \
position, and it will be applied to a real contract as though it were ours. \
This binds "aggressive" to the preferred position's figures absolutely; \
"moderate" should use them too unless it is deliberately landing on the \
acceptable/fallback position, in which case use THAT position's figures.
 • NEVER emit a placeholder. No "[AMOUNT]", "[MUTUALLY AGREED]", "[X]", \
"[INSERT ...]", "TBD", or blank underscores — this text goes into a legal \
document. If no figure is available, keep the original's formulation rather \
than inventing a blank for someone to fill in.
 • changes[].before MUST be a verbatim substring of the original clause \
text. If nothing clean to quote, skip that change entry.
 • proposedText must be a complete, self-contained rewrite (not a diff).
 • Don't fabricate facts, numbers, or entity names — keep the ones from \
the original clause unless the playbook's rules explicitly say otherwise.
 • Stay in the domain/register of the original clause (if it's formal \
contract English, stay formal)."""

 • Target the playbook position marked "preferred". If the original clause is \
so far from it that a wholesale rewrite would read as a non-starter, target \
"acceptable" or "fallback" instead and say which in the rationale.
 • CARRY THE PLAYBOOK'S NUMBERS THROUGH EXACTLY. Where the position states a \
figure — a multiplier, a cap, a notice period, a percentage, a duration — your \
rewrite MUST use that same figure. Writing a cap of a different size is not a \
softer version of the position, it is a DIFFERENT position, and it will be \
applied to a real contract as though it were ours.
 • NEVER emit a placeholder. No "[AMOUNT]", "[MUTUALLY AGREED]", "[X]", \
"[INSERT ...]", "TBD", or blank underscores. This text goes into a legal \
document. If the playbook gives you no figure and the original has none, keep \
the original's formulation rather than inventing a blank to fill in.
 • changes[].before MUST be a verbatim substring of the original clause text. \
Skip the entry rather than paraphrase.
 • proposedText is a complete self-contained clause, not a diff.
 • Never invent facts, figures, dates or party names. Carry over the ones in \
the original unless the playbook explicitly requires otherwise.
 • Stay in the register of the original clause."""
