"""
Provider router (D.0.3, Python side)

Asks the Node API "what's the resolved (provider, model, apiKey) tuple for
(orgId, tier)?" and returns a configured LangChain BaseChatModel.

Why a router and not just env vars?
  - Per-org BYOK: orgs can paste their own OpenAI / Anthropic / Google
    keys; we must use the org's key when present (their cost, their
    rate limit) and fall back to the platform key otherwise.
  - Per-org tier overrides: an admin can flip "all reasoning calls go
    to GPT-4.1" via the AI Config UI (D.0.8); the router honours the
    override automatically.
  - Multi-provider abstraction: code that calls resolve_llm() doesn't
    care which provider answers — just gives a tier and gets back a
    LangChain BaseChatModel.

Backward compatibility:
  - Pre-existing agents (review, redline, assist, draft, …) call
    config.active_provider() / smart_model() / active_model(). Those
    keep working — they don't pass an org_id and so don't go through
    this router.
  - New agent code (the app-wide hero + side agent landing in D1/D2)
    will pass org_id=req.user.orgId and route per-org.
