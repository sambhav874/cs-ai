/**
 * worker-entrypoint.ts — runs the BullMQ workers as a standalone process, with
 * no Fastify API attached.
 *
 * Wave 4: in prod the API runs on Cloud Run with `--min-instances 0` (scale to
 * zero). Because the workers were imported into the API process, the time-based
 * jobs — approval escalation (48h), signature reminders (T-3d/T-1d), and the
 * daily obligation/renewal scans — silently never fired while the service was
 * idle. This entrypoint is deployed as a dedicated always-on worker service
 * (`--min-instances 1`), and the API service sets `WORKERS_ENABLED=false` so
 * jobs aren't double-consumed.
 *
 * Cloud Run still requires the container to listen on $PORT for its health
 * check, so we expose a tiny HTTP endpoint alongside the workers.
