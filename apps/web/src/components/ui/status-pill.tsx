 * Default treatment is a neutral pill with a colored meaning dot. That gives
 * one colored element per row, which stays scannable down a column of two
 * hundred. `tone="wash"` fills the pill with the meaning color and is reserved
 * for a single row-level exception per screen — an escalated contract, a failed
 * import — never for a whole column.
 *
 * Pass a raw API status (`PENDING_REVIEW`) and it resolves its own label and
 * meaning from lib/status. Pass `meaning` + `children` to label something that
 * isn't in an enum.

   *
   * The design system's own map colours the label too, and that reads well in
   * its mockup, where eight rows carry eight different statuses. A real
   * portfolio is not shaped like that: it is ~56% executed, so colouring the
   * label made emerald the modal colour of the product. The majority state
   * (which needs nothing from anyone) shouted, and the 5% that need a human
   * whispered — the exact inversion the design system says it exists to
   * prevent, and the reason it calls the brand colour "spent sparingly".
   *
   * With a neutral label, a column of 147 executed rows reads as a calm field
   * of small green dots, and one red "Expired" or amber "In review" is
   * genuinely the loudest thing on screen.
