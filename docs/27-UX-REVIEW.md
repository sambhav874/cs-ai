# 27 — End-User UX Review

> **Status**: complete (v1).
> **Reviewer**: acting as a new end-user who has never seen this product.
> **Scope**: every screen reachable from `/login`, every major flow, responsive behaviour, session continuity, and every secondary / admin / stub page.
> **Evidence**: 72 screenshots in `scripts/screenshots/desktop/` (numbered), 4 in `scripts/screenshots/walkthrough/`, and static code review of every page component under `apps/web/src/pages/` + the shared layout (`apps/web/src/components/layout/`).
> **Perspective**: "is this obvious and easy for the user?"

## Evaluation rubric

| Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **BLOCKER** | User can't continue; dead end; silent failure; test data leaked to prod-like demo. |
| **MAJOR** | Primary intent takes >2 extra steps or is hidden; confusing label; missing feedback; broken nav. |
| **MINOR** | Polish — inconsistent spacing, suboptimal order, truncation, small overlaps. |
| **DELIGHT** | Something that went beyond what I'd expect. |

For every finding: **what I did → what I expected → what happened → severity → fix idea**.

## Walk 1 — First-time arrival (Login)

**What I did**: opened `http://localhost:5173/` in a fresh browser session with no cookies.

**What I saw** (`01-login.png`):

- Card centred vertically and horizontally on an off-white page.
- Heading: `Sign in` / subtitle: `to CLM Platform`.
- Two labelled inputs (Email with placeholder `you@company.com`, Password with dots).
- Full-width blue `Sign in` button.
- Bottom line: `No account? Create one` (link to `/register`).
- No logo, no brand mark, no tagline, nothing around the card.

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | No "Forgot password?" link. A user who mistyped their password once is stuck. | Add a `Forgot password?` link under the password field (route to a stub that says "Contact your admin" until reset is built). |
| **MAJOR** | No SSO affordance (Google / Microsoft / Okta). Every enterprise CLM buyer expects SSO on the login screen. | V1: add a "Sign in with SSO →" button that routes to an enterprise-login stub. V1.1: wire real OIDC. |
| **MINOR** | No logo / brand. The page says "CLM Platform" which is the product's codename, not the customer's org. | Respect `organization.brandColor` + `logoUrl` on the login screen when the host/subdomain is known. Today those only show AFTER login. |
| **MINOR** | The `Sign in` button reads `Signing in…` on click but doesn't dim or disable visually. Can be re-clicked on slow networks. | Add `disabled` + spinner icon while the mutation is in-flight. |
| **DELIGHT** | `No account? Create one` is a plain-English CTA. Many enterprise apps bury registration — this doesn't. |  |

---

## Walk 2 — Register / Create account

**What I did**: clicked `Create one` from login.

**What I saw** (`02-register.png`):

- Card with heading `Create account` / subtitle `Set up your CLM workspace`.
- Four fields: Company name, Your name, Email, Password.
- Blue `Create account` button.
- `Already have an account? Sign in` link.

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | No password strength indicator. User can register with `password` — genuinely happens in CLM demos. | Add a live strength meter with minimum bar (length + variety). |
| **MAJOR** | No terms / privacy checkbox. Legally iffy for an enterprise CLM, and definitely missing for EU users. | Add a required checkbox: `I agree to the Terms and Privacy Policy` with links to the policies. |
| **MINOR** | No confirmation step. A single typo in the password and the user is locked out of their own new workspace. | Add `Confirm password` or a second-step email verification. |
| **MINOR** | "Company name" becomes the org name, but the field accepts ANY string. No uniqueness check, no slug preview. | V1: show a preview like `acme-corp.clm.app` under the field. |

---

## Walk 3 — Accept-invite page

**What I did**: read `AcceptInvitePage.tsx` (130 lines) + screenshot `03-accept-invite.png`.

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | After accepting the invite, the user is logged in but the page doesn't tell them where to go next. | Redirect to `/dashboard` with a one-time toast: "Welcome to {orgName}! Here's what your team is working on." |
| **MINOR** | No expired-invite state copy: "This invitation expired on X — ask your admin to re-send." | Render a branded error state for `410 Gone` or expired tokens. |

---

## Walk 4 — Global navigation (sidebar + header)

**What I did**: inspected `04-dashboard.png` + read `Sidebar.tsx` + `Header.tsx`.

**What I saw**:

Sidebar (`Sidebar.tsx`):
- **CORE**: Dashboard, Contracts, Requests, Counterparties
- **LEGAL**: Templates, Clause Library, Playbook, Approvals
- **ADMIN** (admin-only): Users, Roles, Organization, Team
- **Bottom**: Settings

Header (`Header.tsx`):
- Left: empty space (no breadcrumbs)
- Right: `AI Assistant` button, bell icon (notifications), user dropdown (Profile / Logout)

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **BLOCKER** | `Analytics` and `Signatures` are registered as routes in `App.tsx` but do NOT appear in the sidebar. They are dead zones. A user who guesses `/analytics` lands on a stub screen ("coming soon") with no nav reference to explain where they are. | Either: (a) add them to the sidebar under a "Coming Soon" section with a clear badge, or (b) remove the routes until the pages are built. Do one of the two — never ship an orphan route. |
| **BLOCKER** | Two "assistants" with identical affordances confuse the mental model:  `AI Assistant` button in the header (opens a `ChatPanel`) vs. `⌘K Ask AI` palette on the contract detail page. A user will click `AI Assistant` on the Dashboard, get a chat that doesn't know about any specific contract, and wonder why it's different from the palette. | Unify. Either collapse `ChatPanel` into the `⌘K` palette (make `⌘K` global, not only on detail page), or label the header button as "Chat with AI" and the palette as "Ask about this contract" with visibly different icons. |
| **MAJOR** | No global search. Users with 100+ contracts can't find "that Zynga NDA" from anywhere except the contracts list. Dashboard, Requests, Approvals all lack it. | Add a `⌘/` (or `⌘J`) global search in the header that searches contracts + clauses + templates + counterparties. |
| **MAJOR** | No breadcrumbs. On `/contracts/cmn16…`, the user sees the contract title as the H1 but has no trail back: the ONLY way back to the list is the `←` icon next to the title. Screen-reader users get no page-hierarchy context. | Add a breadcrumb row under the header: `Contracts › {counterparty} › {title}`. |
| **MAJOR** | The sidebar `CLM Platform` top-left is not a link. Convention is that the logo returns you to the dashboard. | Wrap the logo in a `<NavLink to="/dashboard">`. |
| **MINOR** | The `Admin` section is visible to admins only (correct) but doesn't distinguish between "org-wide" (Users/Roles/Organization) and "team-scoped" (Team). The `Team` page has completely different scope. | Move `Team` up to `CORE` (everyone sees their team). Keep `Users`, `Roles`, `Organization` as admin-only. |
| **MINOR** | Sidebar badges only show `pendingApprovals` (Approvals) and `openRequests` (Requests). Nothing on `Contracts` for "stuck in extraction", nothing on `Counterparties` for "unmatched". | Add a red dot (no count) on Contracts when any are in `FAILED` status, so admins know to fix them. |

---

## Walk 5 — Dashboard

**What I did**: signed in as admin, landed on `/dashboard`.

**What I saw** (`04-dashboard.png`):

- `Welcome back, Admin` / `Here's what's happening with your contracts today.`
- 4 KPI cards: Active Contracts (16), Open Requests (0), Pending Approvals (0), Expiring Soon (0) — each clickable.
- 3 Quick Action buttons: `Upload Contract`, `New Request`, `View Approvals`.
- `Recent Activity` list with 8 entries — of which 7 say `Contract updated` by `System`.

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | **Recent Activity is noise, not signal.** 7 of 8 entries read `Contract updated · System · 3/22/2026`. No contract name, no action specifics, no user. A user learns nothing from this feed — it's worse than having no feed because it creates the impression nothing important has happened. | Every activity entry must include: (a) the contract title, (b) the concrete action ("approved", "edited §8.3", "sent to Zynga"), (c) the actor. Filter out `System` updates from user-facing feeds entirely (they're plumbing, not events). |
| **MAJOR** | `Expiring Soon` (value 0) links to `/contracts` with NO filter applied. A user clicks the card expecting to see expiring contracts — sees all 16, and has to figure out the filter themselves. | Link to `/contracts?expiryDateTo={in-90-days}` and pre-select that facet. |
| **MAJOR** | `Upload Contract` in Quick Actions navigates to `/contracts` (not directly to the upload modal). One extra click wasted every upload. | Route to `/contracts?upload=1` and auto-open the upload modal on mount. |
| **MINOR** | No "Your day" section — e.g., "3 contracts waiting on you" (even if all zero). A zero-state that acknowledges the user's actual workload beats an anonymous KPI grid. | Add a top band: "You have X approvals to decide, Y contracts to draft, Z about to expire." |
| **MINOR** | `Expiring Soon` is red (`text-red-600`) even when the count is 0. That trains the user to ignore red. | Only tint red when count > 0; otherwise neutral grey. |

---

## Walk 6 — Contracts list

**What I did**: clicked `Contracts` in sidebar.

**What I saw** (`05-contracts.png`):

- Heading: `Contract Repository` / `17 contracts`.
- Top-right: `Filters`, `Upload`, `New Contract` (three buttons).
- Search: `Search by title, counterparty, or content...`.
- Table columns: CONTRACT (title + type + date), STATUS, COUNTERPARTY, EXPIRES, RISK.
- Some rows have small `Failed` or `Queued` pills next to title.
- Some rows are literally `Unnamed Contract - No Identified Parties` / `Unidentified Contract - Missing Party Details`.
- No bulk-select.
- No pagination visible at 17 rows.

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | **Two upload-ish buttons: `Upload` and `New Contract`.** Labels don't communicate the difference. `Upload` presumably opens `UploadModal` (pick a PDF), `New Contract` presumably opens `NewContractFlow` (draft from a template). These are very different intents. | Relabel: `Upload PDF` + `Draft new` with distinct icons. Or collapse into one `+` menu with two options: `Upload existing` / `Draft new`. |
| **MAJOR** | **`Unnamed Contract - No Identified Parties`** and **`Unidentified Contract - Missing Party Details`** leak into the list as literal titles. Looks like a data-entry problem, not a placeholder. When a buyer sees "Unnamed Contract" for seconds during their upload → panic. | When a contract has no title yet, fall back to the original filename (e.g. `b5-walkthrough-nda.pdf`) until analysis finishes. Once analysis finishes, use the extracted title or a status-specific placeholder like "Untitled (analysis failed — click to retry)". |
| **MAJOR** | **No way to re-run analysis from the list.** Three contracts show `Failed` — but the user has to click into each one, find the Actions menu, and retry. That's a nightmare for an admin cleaning up 20 failures. | Add a row-level `Retry` affordance on `Failed` contracts + a bulk "Retry failed" action when any failures exist. |
| **MINOR** | `EXPIRES` column shows dates like `Apr 24, 19` (2019). The contract status is `DRAFT`. Either the data is wrong (the date is 2019 so why is it DRAFT?) or the display is wrong (date actually 2029 but showing as 19). Two-digit years are ambiguous in legal context. | Display four-digit years. Also flag "expiry in the past" with a red background on the date cell. |
| **MINOR** | No bulk-select checkboxes. Can't archive 5 old contracts in one go. | Add row-checkbox + bulk action bar on the top of the table. |
| **MINOR** | No pagination / infinite scroll indicator. 17 contracts fit; what about 500? | Add a "Showing 17 of 17" footer + pagination. |

---

## Walk 7 — Upload + new-contract flows

**What I did**: read `UploadModal.tsx` and `NewContractFlow.tsx` + smoke-tested the upload flow via `scripts/b5-walkthrough.mjs` in an earlier session.

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | After upload, the user lands on the detail page in `PENDING` state watching a blue progress banner (`Queued → Parsing → Classifying → Extracting → Analyzing → Indexing`). On a 44-second pipeline that's… 44 seconds of watching progress. Nothing tells the user: "you can close this tab and we'll email you when it's ready." | Add a persistent toast: "We're analysing your contract. This takes ~30-60 seconds. You can close the tab — we'll notify you when it's ready." |
| **MINOR** | Progress banner shows 6 pipeline steps but does not estimate time remaining or percentage. A user has no sense of whether they're 10% or 90% done. | Show a thin progress bar or an estimated time like `About 30s remaining`. |
| **MINOR** | If Gotenberg / the AI worker is down, the user sees `Processing timed out — the job may have crashed mid-flight.` with a Retry button. Good message — but there's no way to escalate ("contact support" / "see status page"). | Add a secondary link under the retry: `Service issue? Contact support`. |

---

## Walk 8 — Contract detail (unified canvas)

**What I did**: opened the WPT Enterprises contract after B.5 landed.

**What I saw** (`36-b51-wpt-ready.png` + `38-b52-styled.png` + many more):

- Header row: `← WPT Enterprises - Zynga License Agreement` + `Draft` status pill + type pill + `Correct type` link + Risk 75% + `Send for Review` (primary).
- Controls row: `[Styled | Original]` toggle, `Risks: Full ▾`, `✨ Ask AI ⌘K`, `Compare`, `Edit`, status CTA, `Actions ▾`.
- Document canvas: beautifully styled contract, real paragraphs, inline red wavy underlines on risky clauses.
- Right rail: Review Progress, Overview (AI summary), Key Terms, Risks, Clauses, History, Comments, Activity, Approval (if relevant).

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | The header is crowded. At 1440px: pill / type / risk / 5 action buttons / Actions menu fit, but barely. At 1280px (below my laptop), the buttons wrap onto multiple lines (`25b-b1-header-crop.png` shows this). Risk of misalignment. | Tighten: collapse `Styled | Original` into the Actions menu when narrow. Drop `⌘K` keyboard-hint kbd on narrow viewports (it still works). |
| **MINOR** | "Correct type" link is a subtle grey. A user who misclassified their contract could benefit from a more obvious affordance. | Show it only when the user hovers the type pill, like an edit pencil. |
| **MINOR** | The `Risks: Full ▾` label reads as a sentence fragment. Not terrible but oddly phrased. | Prefer `Risk markers: Full` or `Show risks: Full`. |
| **DELIGHT** | The contract-paper CSS is legitimately beautiful. Times serif, justified paragraphs, realistic margins. Users feel like they're looking at "the contract", not "a form". |  |
| **DELIGHT** | The `[Styled | Original]` toggle respects Legal's actual mental model — "show me the exact PDF". Most CLMs I've seen just render HTML and hope. |  |

---

## Walk 9 — ⌘K palette + bubble menu + edit

**What I did**: pressed ⌘K; triple-clicked a paragraph in edit mode; bold-ed selected text.

**What I saw** (`50-b59-header-ask-ai.png`, `51-b59-palette-open.png`, `52-b59-palette-answer.png`, `40-b53-edit-mode.png`, `49-b58-bubble-menu.png`):

- ⌘K opens a centred modal with 5 default suggestions, placeholder `Ask AI anything about this contract…`.
- Answers come back in ~5s grounded with clause sources.
- Edit mode: undo/redo/save-state/Done in the header; bubble menu appears on selection with Bold / Italic / Underline / H2 / ✨ AI.

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MINOR** | The palette `Rewrite selection more restrictively` suggestion shows a `write` tag but no indication that clicking it will show a `Write actions need a preview step — coming in v1.1` placeholder. A user expecting a rewrite clicks and gets a "we haven't shipped this yet" message. Bad first impression. | Disable that suggestion (grey + `Coming soon`) until v1.1 write-flow lands, OR drop the suggestion from the default list. |
| **DELIGHT** | The bubble menu's `✨ AI` button preserves the selection and opens the palette with "About this passage: …" pre-filled. That's the kind of hand-off that makes the whole canvas feel cohesive. |  |
| **DELIGHT** | Grounded sources are visible under the answer with clause type labels (termination, payment, confidentiality…). Users can verify the answer without leaving the palette. |  |

---

## Walk 10 — Compare Versions

**What I did**: clicked `Compare` on a contract with 14 versions.

**What I saw** (`61-b513-compare-mode.png`):

- Fullscreen dialog: `Compare versions  [v14 Newer] vs. [v13 Older]  Attribution chips  Filter: all / theirs / ours / pending  ×`.
- Inline `↓ Per-change Accept/Reject with attribution arrives in v1.1; for now use bulk:` with disabled `Accept all theirs` and `Reject all theirs`.
- Real diff markup in the body.

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | The filter chips (`all / theirs / ours / pending`) are active-looking buttons but don't actually filter anything (documented as v1.1 stubs in the code). A user who clicks "theirs" expects to see only counterparty changes, sees no change, and concludes the UI is broken. | Either wire them or grey them out with a `Coming in v1.1` tooltip. As-is they erode trust. |
| **MINOR** | The version pickers show only version numbers (`v14` / `v13`) — no hint of who made them or when from the picker itself. The attribution chips to the right of the pickers *do* show this, but the two pieces of information should be next to each other. | Make picker options read `v14 · admin · today` so the user can pick by time / person without looking at two places. |
| **DELIGHT** | Mode-not-tab is the right call. A buyer told us the negotiate tab was a burial ground; this is the fix. |  |

---

## Walk 11 — Focused Review drawer

**What I did**: clicked an inline red risk marker.

**What I saw** (`45-b56-drawer-open.png`, `04-focused-review.png`):

- Rail replaced by a drawer: `{N / M}` counter, clause type heading (red), `WHY THIS MATTERS`, `AI SUGGESTION`, `PLAYBOOK REFERENCE`, state picker, `Reject / Edit / Accept as is / Mark Reviewed`, comments field.

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MINOR** | Three primary-style buttons (`Reject`, `Edit`, `Accept`) + `Mark Reviewed` in a row = four competing CTAs. A new user doesn't know which is the default / safest. | Make `Accept` the primary (blue), the others secondary. Or order them by commonality: `Mark Reviewed (most common) · Accept · Edit · Reject`. |
| **DELIGHT** | WHY / SUGGESTION / PLAYBOOK REF separation is exactly right — each is a distinct cognitive unit. Approvers have asked for this for years in every CLM demo I've seen. |  |

---

## Walk 12 — Approver Mode + Precedents

**What I did**: loaded a contract where I'm the pending approver.

**What I saw** (`54-b510-approver-mode.png`, `57-b511-precedents.png`):

- Amber strip above the document: `AWAITING YOUR DECISION  Confidence 55%  Risk 75%  AI: Review required  Top blocker: Liability cap is 2x…  [Approve] [Reject] [Delegate]`.
- In the rail under `Decision`, a `PRECEDENTS` section: `15% higher risk than peer avg`, `64% iPass Inc. Apr 2026 Risk 70%`, `56% Diversinet Corp Mar 2026 Risk 60%`.

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | Reject requires a reason (correct) but the Delegate path asks for a raw "user ID". No one types a user ID. A user-picker is mandatory. | Replace the Delegate text input with a type-ahead user-picker that searches by name/email. |
| **MINOR** | Precedents similarity scores (64%, 56%) are technical — user has no context for what's "good". | Add a tooltip: `Similarity: how closely this deal resembles this precedent by clause content`. Or show a descriptor: `Very similar (64%)`. |
| **DELIGHT** | The `Top blocker: …` with `→ jump` is the single best UX decision on this page. One click takes you to the paragraph; you read it yourself; you decide. |  |

---

## Walk 13 — Counterparty portal

**What I did**: created a share link, opened the portal URL in an anonymous tab.

**What I saw** (`62-b514-portal-trust-band.png`, `63-b514-portal-uploaded.png`):

- Green trust band: `✓ Shared by Demo Org  ⏰ Expires in 1d  · B.5.14 verify link  [Download .docx] [Upload revised]`.
- Styled contract pane below, Comments tab to the right.
- After upload: `✓ Uploaded v15 · tmp-portal-upload.pdf. The owner has been notified.`.

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | The portal uploads a raw file but does NOT re-extract or render it. Back in the main app the new version is an empty document (we discovered this during B.5.17 verify when WPT's v15 had no clauses). So the "revised version" the counterparty uploads is invisible until someone manually clicks `Re-analyze`. | After upload, enqueue the parse + extract pipeline so the new version is processable as soon as the owner opens it. Already listed as a follow-up in B.5.14 commit but still a user-visible gap today. |
| **MINOR** | The trust band says `Shared by Demo Org`. "Demo Org" is the seed org name and would normally be the real customer's org. Fine for this verify run, but the trust signal depends on the org name being trustworthy-looking. The design should assume org names like `Acme Inc.` — not failure cases like `Untitled Workspace 3`. | Validate org name on create: must be ≥ 3 characters, no numbers-only, no generic placeholders. |
| **DELIGHT** | The "Shared by" + "Expires in Xd" combo is exactly the reassurance the counterparty needs in their first 5 seconds on the page. |  |

---

## Walk 14 — Signer portal (/sign/:token)

**What I did**: opened `/sign/:token`.

**What I saw** (`64-b515-signer-portal.png`, `65-b515-signer-sign-click.png`):

- Slim blue branded header.
- Document in a centred pane.
- Sticky bottom bar: `Ready to sign? … [Sign]` (green).
- Clicking Sign opens a modal: "Signature capture lands in A.4".

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | The Sign placeholder modal is appropriately honest ("eSignature capture lands with A.4") but a real signer arriving here will be frustrated — they can't actually sign. | Hide the Sign button entirely behind an `ENABLE_ESIGN` feature flag until A.4 lands, and redirect `/sign/:token` to the read-only counterparty portal with a banner: "Signing link — awaiting signature tooling. View-only for now." |
| **DELIGHT** | Minimal chrome. No sidebar, no comments tab, no AI, no risks, no versions. The signer sees only what they need to decide. |  |

---

## Walk 15 — Secondary pages (Requests + Counterparties)

**Requests** (`07-requests.png`):

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | Requests is one of the CORE nav items but has no onboarding — an empty-state "Submit your first request" button. A new user has no idea what a "request" is in the CLM model (it's when someone asks Legal to draft a contract). | Add one-paragraph description under the heading: "Ask Legal to draft a contract. Fill out what you need and they'll produce the first version." |
| **MINOR** | Tabs (All / Submitted / In Review / More Info / Accepted / Rejected) have no counts. If I'm an approver I'd want to see which tab has work. | Show count badges per tab. |

**Counterparties** (`08-counterparties.png`):

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | **No "Contracts" column.** The primary reason a user visits Counterparties is to see "how many contracts with Acme". Today they have to click in and count. | Add a `# CONTRACTS` column showing the count per counterparty, clickable → filtered contracts list. |
| **MAJOR** | Rows don't appear clickable. No chevron, no hover shadow, no pointer cursor. Is clicking a row the same as clicking the name? | Add a chevron / hover state. Make the whole row clickable. |
| **MINOR** | Every counterparty shows `—` under Email and Website because those are optional fields the seed doesn't populate. Columns full of dashes look broken. | Hide the Email / Website columns until ≥ 1 counterparty has them populated. |
| **MINOR** | No quick-filter ("Active", "Inactive", "New"). | Add a status tag per counterparty + filter. |

---

## Walk 16 — Templates

**What I saw** (`09-templates.png`):

- Grid of 6 cards, per-card: type pill (SOW/MSA/NDA), version, section count, variable count.
- Per-card action icons: eye (preview), pencil (edit), trash (delete).

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **BLOCKER** | **"Aniket NDA"** visible as a template in the demo workspace. It's a test artefact — 1 section, 0 variables. A buyer seeing this during a sales demo walks. This kind of test data must never escape into a demo-worthy state. | Add a `scripts/clean-demo.mjs` that's run before any demo: deletes anything whose title/name looks like test data (`Aniket`, `Temp`, `Test`, `My Cat`, etc.). Also enforce naming conventions when creating new templates. |
| **MAJOR** | Two `Master Services Agreemen…` and two `Mutual NDA — Standard` cards. Are they different versions? Different templates with the same name? Card design doesn't clarify. | Require template names to be unique within a type. If they're different versions of the same template, show one card and indicate `v3 · 2 previous`. |
| **MAJOR** | Per-card icons (eye, pencil, trash) are tiny and their meaning isn't obvious. Eye = preview? Or "set visible"? Pencil = edit. Trash = delete (no confirm!). | Add tooltips (`Preview`, `Edit`, `Delete`). Make delete a two-step confirm. |
| **MINOR** | Green globe icon next to some template titles — no legend. Presumably "published" or "available globally" but unclear. | Add a tooltip / replace with a label badge (`Published` / `Draft`). |
| **MINOR** | No "Use this template" primary CTA on each card. The card is an inspection view, not a usage view. | Make card body clickable (`Use this template →`), and reserve the icon row for card-management actions. |

---

## Walk 17 — Clause Library

**What I saw** (`10-clauses.png`):

- 3-column layout: categories / clause list / editor pane.
- Right pane: `Select a clause to edit, or create a new one`.

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **BLOCKER** | **Test data AND typos in the clause library.** `Temp` clause at top. Category `My Categoty` (TYPO). Sub-category `My Cat`. Duplicate categories `Limitation of Liability` (2x) and `IP Ownership` (2x) and `Confidentiality` (2x). This is a CLM's most-important content store — when a buyer sees typos and duplicates here they assume the whole product is sloppy. | Same cleanup script as Templates. Additionally: enforce unique category names per org, prevent duplicates, and don't allow empty-named categories. |
| **MAJOR** | `used 0×` on every single clause. Either the counter isn't wired up (likely — nothing has been drafted from the library) or the counting is broken. Either way the user sees zero adoption. | If count is 0, say `Unused` — no number. Only show the count when > 0. |
| **MAJOR** | No obvious "New clause" button. Right pane says "or create a new one" but there's no button. Users are told to do something and given no affordance to do it. | Add a prominent `+ New clause` button in the clause list column header. |
| **MAJOR** | The right pane doesn't show a clause when you click one in the list — or the screenshot suggests it doesn't. (The clause list is populated but right pane is still the empty state.) | If this is a bug, fix the selection handler. If it's because the seed has no clauses selected by default, select the first clause automatically. |
| **MINOR** | Clause title `Perpetual Confidentiality` has `unfavorable` (red pill) and below it `perpetual`, `trade-secret`, `aggressive` tags. Useful. But the `approved` pill on OTHER clauses is the same green — risk of confusing "approved" (workflow state) with "favorable" (risk label). | Differentiate: risk pill = coloured-outline with a shield icon; approval pill = solid-filled with a check icon. |
| **MINOR** | "+" in the Categories header is 11×11px and grey. Easy to miss. | Make it a button with `+ Category` label. |

---

## Walk 18 — Playbook

**What I saw** (`11-playbook.png`):

- Left: category tree (same typo + duplicates as Clause Library).
- Right: empty state `Select a clause category to manage its playbook positions`.

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | **No guidance on what a "playbook" is.** A new user has no idea whether to click a category, create a new one, etc. The subtitle `Negotiation positions per clause type` is technical jargon. | Add a short explainer panel for first-time visitors: "A playbook defines your preferred, acceptable, and reject-worthy positions for each clause. When AI drafts or reviews a contract it uses these as ground truth." |
| **MAJOR** | No "new category" button visible on this page either. The + icon on Clause Library doesn't flow here. | Add `+ New category` on the left column. |
| **MINOR** | The right pane is completely empty in the default state. No preview of a sample playbook position so a user knows what to expect. | Show a ghost/preview layout of what a position looks like ("Ideal: our standard · Fallback: one rev · Hard stop: X"). |

---

## Walk 19 — Approvals

**What I saw** (`12-approvals.png`, `12b-approvals-workflows.png`):

- Tabs: `My Queue` / `Manage Workflows`.
- My Queue: `All clear  No contracts are awaiting your approval.` with an inbox icon. Nicely done.
- Manage Workflows: `No workflows yet. Create one to route approvals.` with a `Create Workflow` CTA inside a dashed box.

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **DELIGHT** | `All clear` empty state is elegant. Inbox icon + polite copy. Feels like Linear. |  |
| **MINOR** | `Manage Workflows` tab doesn't explain that a workflow is required for approvals to work. If there are zero workflows, `Submit for Approval` buttons throughout the app will fail silently. | Add a system-level warning bar: "You have 0 workflows. Approvals won't work until you create one → Create workflow". |

---

## Walk 20 — Team

**What I saw** (`16-team.png`):

- Heading: `Team Workload` / `Monitor team capacity, workload, and out-of-office status.`
- Top-right: `Set OOO` (single action).
- Two cards: `Admin User` (15 active contracts, 0 approvals pending, RED workload bar) and `Legal Counsel` (1 active, 0 approvals, GREEN workload bar).

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MINOR** | Workload colour scale is binary: "Admin User 15 active" = fully red bar; "Legal Counsel 1 active" = tiny green bar. The cutoff between red/amber/green is opaque to the user. | Document the cutoffs in a tooltip on the Workload label (`≤5 green · 6-10 amber · ≥11 red`). |
| **MINOR** | `Set OOO` has no explanation of what happens when you set OOO (do incoming contracts route elsewhere? are you removed from workflows?). | Tooltip or inline hint. |
| **DELIGHT** | Two-card layout clearly communicates capacity. Manager can tell at a glance who's slammed. |  |

---

## Walk 21 — Admin (Users / Roles / Organization)

**Users** (`18-admin-users.png`): table with Name / Email / Status / Roles / Last Active. `Invite User` primary top-right. `Legal Counsel` shows `Last Active: Never` — clear signal.

**Roles** (`19-admin-roles.png`): list of 9 system roles, each with name + description + permission count. Every row shows `System` lock badge. `Custom role editing is coming soon.` explainer up top.

**Organization** (`20-admin-org.png`): left menu (General / Alert Rules / AI Config / System Dashboard / Data Management). General: Organization Name, Logo URL, Brand Color, Subscription Tier.

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | Several roles (`FINANCE`, `PROCUREMENT`, `SALES_REP`) show `0 permissions`. They exist but do nothing. A user shown a role with 0 permissions wonders whether they should use it. | Either remove them from the seed (they'll be added when needed) or give them a minimum default permission set (`view` on `contract` at least). |
| **MINOR** | Brand Color is a free-text input like `#3B82F6`. Non-designer users don't know hex. | Replace with a color-picker. |
| **MINOR** | Logo URL is a URL text input — users have to host their logo somewhere else first. | Add a file uploader that stores to the app's storage + returns a URL. |

---

## Walk 22 — Settings

**What I saw** (`15-settings.png`):

- Left menu: Custom Fields / General / Notifications.
- Custom Fields default: `No custom fields yet. Add fields like "Survival Period" or "Auto-Renewal Notice Days"…` with an `Add your first field` CTA.

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MINOR** | `General` has nothing on this screenshot. What does it contain? | Confirm it's not blank. |
| **MINOR** | `Settings` exists in the sidebar bottom corner AND `Organization Settings` exists under Admin. Two different places for settings with overlap potential. | Clarify naming. `Settings` (in sidebar) = MY settings. `Organization` = ADMIN settings. Today the labels don't make that distinction. |

---

## Walk 23 — Profile

**What I saw** (`17-profile.png`):

- 3 cards: Profile Info (Name / Email / Avatar URL), My Roles (ADMIN), Change Password.

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MINOR** | `Avatar URL` is a text input asking for a URL. Same issue as Org logo — users don't host images. | File upload component. |
| **MINOR** | Email field shows `admin@demo.com` as placeholder — NOT the user's actual current email. A quick glance might make a user wonder why their email was changed to a placeholder. | Show the current email as the value, not just a placeholder. |

---

## Walk 24 — Dead / stub pages

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **BLOCKER** | `/analytics` and `/signatures` are both 17-line stubs showing only `Analytics / Reporting & dashboards coming soon.` and `Signatures / eSign integration coming soon.`. They are NOT in the sidebar so they're unreachable by honest navigation — but they ARE in `App.tsx` `<Routes>` so a user who types them (or follows a stale link from an old email) lands on a dead screen with zero explanation of what they are supposed to do next. | Until the real pages ship: remove the routes from `App.tsx` or redirect to `/dashboard` with a toast: "Analytics is coming soon — join the waitlist at Settings → Notifications." |

---

## Walk 25 — Responsive

**What I saw** (`66-b516-desktop.png`, `67-b516-tablet-closed.png`, `68-b516-tablet-open.png`, `69-b516-mobile-closed.png`, `70-b516-mobile-open.png`):

- Desktop ≥ 1280: two-column as designed.
- Tablet 768–1279: floating `^ Details` pill; rail slides in from right with backdrop; × + Esc close.
- Mobile < 768: peek sheet pinned to bottom, 64px peek visible; tap header to expand.

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | At 1024px the contract detail HEADER wraps badly: status pill falls to a second line, type pill to a third, Decision Strip text overflows (see `67-b516-tablet-closed.png`). The rail drawer works — but the page above it does not fit. | Collapse secondary header controls into an overflow menu below 1280px. Tighten the DecisionStrip pills (shorter labels: `Conf 55%`, `Risk 75%`). |
| **MINOR** | Mobile: the global sidebar is completely hidden (good for space) but there's no hamburger menu to re-open it. Users on mobile can't navigate between pages at all. | Add a top-left hamburger button that opens the sidebar as a left drawer on mobile. |
| **MINOR** | Mobile rail peek: `DETAILS` label in the header is fine, but the peek is so thin (64px) the user might not realise they can drag/tap to expand. | Add a tiny caret (`▲`) on the grab handle. |

---

## Walk 26 — Session continuity

**What I did**: read `Header.tsx` logout flow + `lib/api.ts` 401 interceptor.

### Findings

| Sev | Finding | Fix idea |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | Logout clears auth and does `navigate('/login')`. But the user's current URL is forgotten — if they were mid-edit at `/contracts/abc`, after logout + login they land on `/dashboard`, not back at `/contracts/abc`. | Store intended URL on logout; if the next login happens within N seconds, restore it. Or more simply: redirect to `/login?next=/contracts/abc` and respect `next` on login. |
| **MINOR** | If the access token expires silently mid-session, a form submission fails with a brief flash of an error before the 401 interceptor refreshes and retries. Not always clean. | Show an unobtrusive `Reconnecting…` toast while the refresh is in flight. |

---

## Cross-cutting findings

Things that span multiple screens:

### Consistency issues

| Sev | Finding |
|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | **Two different AI entry points with overlapping intent**: `AI Assistant` button in header (opens `ChatPanel`) and `⌘K Ask AI` on contract detail (opens `AiCommandPalette`). The user's mental model gets split. Pick one and unify. |
| **MAJOR** | **Three different "status" vocabularies**: contract status (DRAFT / PENDING_REVIEW / …), approval state (APPROVED / REJECTED / DELEGATED), clause review state (unreviewed / accepted / rejected). They use overlapping words with different meanings. A contract `APPROVED` means workflow passed; a clause `approved` is a quality tag. |
| **MINOR** | Button shapes vary: most are rounded-md; a few are rounded-lg; some are rounded-full (the Details pill, the Ask AI Add chip). Tighten to two shapes total. |
| **MINOR** | Icons for the same concept vary across screens: "document" = `FileText` in some places, `FileEdit` in others. |

### Data quality visible in the UI

| Sev | Finding |
|---|---|
| **BLOCKER** | Test/scratch data is visible in customer-facing areas: `Aniket NDA` template, `Temp` clause, `My Categoty` (typo category), `My Cat` sub-category, duplicate `Limitation of Liability` / `IP Ownership` / `Confidentiality` categories. This would fail a pre-demo inspection. |
| **MAJOR** | Empty extractions leak through as titles: `Unnamed Contract - No Identified Parties`, `Unidentified Contract - Missing Party Details`. These read as bugs, not placeholders. |

### Accessibility

| Sev | Finding |
|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | No global `role="main"` landmark on the layout (it's a raw `<main>` — good — but the sidebar is a `<aside>` without a `role="navigation"`). |
| **MAJOR** | Icon-only buttons (Upload modal triggers, per-template icon row, close × buttons) often lack `aria-label`. |
| **MINOR** | Colour contrast on grey placeholder text (e.g. `#A0A0A0` on white) fails WCAG AA in places. |
| **DELIGHT** | Risk markers now have `role="button"` + `aria-label` + `tabindex="0"` + Enter/Space activation (landed in B.5.17). |

### Error handling

| Sev | Finding |
|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | Mutation errors (save, approval decide, share creation) often surface as tiny red text that disappears on the next interaction. No toast system. | 
| **MAJOR** | Network-down states aren't announced. If the API goes down mid-session, the user sees stale data with no indicator. |

### Onboarding

| Sev | Finding |
|---|---|
| **DELIGHT** | First-visit coach marks on the contract detail page (B.5.17) are exactly the right intervention. |
| **MAJOR** | Onboarding only covers the detail page. Dashboard, Contracts, Templates, Clauses, Playbook all have their own learnable concepts and no coach marks. |

## Final verdict

> **The unified canvas (B.5) is production-quality.** Every contract-detail interaction — document rendering, risk markers, focused review, ⌘K palette, bubble menu, Compare mode, Approver mode, Precedents, Counterparty portal, Signer stub — works, is fast, is visually coherent, and responds like a 2026 product.
>
> **The shell around it is not.** Test data, orphan routes, inconsistent AI entry points, missing global search, duplicated categories with typos, and dead nav stubs erode the confidence the canvas earns. These are all small fixes individually, but together they make the difference between "polished product" and "promising prototype".

### What must be fixed before a customer demo

These are the blockers and majors that a visitor would *see* in the first 60 seconds of a demo.

1. **Delete test data** (`Aniket NDA`, `Temp`, `My Categoty`, `My Cat`, duplicate categories). Ship a `scripts/clean-demo.mjs` and run it before every demo. **(BLOCKER × 2)**
2. **Either wire or hide `/analytics` + `/signatures` stubs**. Today they're orphan routes. **(BLOCKER)**
3. **Unify the two AI entry points**. The header `AI Assistant` and the `⌘K Ask AI` palette need to be one experience. **(BLOCKER)**
4. **Fix `Recent Activity` on the Dashboard** — 7 of 8 entries reading `Contract updated · System` is worse than no feed. **(MAJOR)**
5. **Rename the contracts-list buttons**: `Upload PDF` + `Draft new` — not `Upload` + `New Contract`. **(MAJOR)**
6. **Add a `# Contracts` column to Counterparties**. This is the single most-used signal on that page and it's missing. **(MAJOR)**
7. **Add `Forgot password?` + SSO button** on login. **(MAJOR × 2)**
8. **Replace Delegate's raw user-ID input** with a type-ahead picker. **(MAJOR)**

### What can wait for v1.1

1. Breadcrumbs / global search / logo-as-link.
2. Bulk actions on the contracts list.
3. File-upload component for logo + avatar (currently URL-only).
4. Password strength + confirm + terms checkbox on Register.
5. Progress estimate on upload pipeline.
6. Counterparty → contracts drill-down link.
7. `Coming in v1.1` badges on stubbed features (Compare filters, signature capture, custom roles).
8. Mobile hamburger for the sidebar.
9. Onboarding coach marks on other pages.
10. Cross-cutting polish on icon consistency, button shapes, WCAG contrast.

### Bottom-line score

| | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Contract detail UX** | 9 / 10 | The unified canvas is genuinely excellent. |
| **Core loops (upload → review → approve → sign)** | 7 / 10 | The happy path works end-to-end; friction at transitions (rename upload buttons, no picker, etc.). |
| **Secondary pages** | 5 / 10 | Templates / Clauses / Playbook have real data-quality issues. |
| **Admin / Settings** | 7 / 10 | Functional but sparse. |
| **Navigation + shell** | 4 / 10 | Two AI entry points, orphan routes, no global search. |
| **Onboarding** | 6 / 10 | Detail page done well; everything else is learn-by-clicking. |
| **Polish / data quality** | 3 / 10 | Test data visible throughout. Biggest single drag on perceived quality. |
| **OVERALL** | **6.5 / 10** | "A great product whose supporting chrome isn't ready for buyers yet." |

### Recommended next 2 days of work

1. **Day 1, morning**: run clean-demo + delete orphan routes + unify AI entry. Clear the BLOCKERs.
2. **Day 1, afternoon**: fix Recent Activity + Counterparties column + contracts-list button labels. Clear the 4 most-visible MAJORs.
3. **Day 2, morning**: SSO button + Forgot password + Delegate user-picker + progress messaging.
4. **Day 2, afternoon**: responsive 1024px header fix + mobile hamburger. Re-run the `ux-review-walk.mjs` script as a regression check.

After those two days the product should be **8 / 10** — ready for a first customer demo.

## Appendix A — Live verification (2026-04-23)

After the main review was written from static analysis + prior screenshots, Docker
was restarted and the top findings were re-checked against the running stack using
`scripts/ux-verify-findings.mjs`.

| # | Finding | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| BLOCKER-1a | `/analytics` is an orphan route | **PASS** — reachable, "Reporting & dashboards coming soon", NOT in sidebar | `scripts/screenshots/ux-verify/01-analytics-orphan.png` |
| BLOCKER-1b | `/signatures` is an orphan route | **PASS** — reachable, "eSign integration coming soon", NOT in sidebar | `scripts/screenshots/ux-verify/02-signatures-orphan.png` |
| BLOCKER-2 | Two AI entry points | **PASS** — `AI Assistant` button visible in header across all pages | `scripts/screenshots/ux-verify/03-dashboard-ai-button.png` |
| BLOCKER-3a | "Aniket NDA" test template leaked | **PASS** — visible in `/templates` | `scripts/screenshots/ux-verify/05-templates.png` |
| BLOCKER-3b | "Temp" test clause leaked | **PASS** — visible in `/clauses` | `scripts/screenshots/ux-verify/06-clauses.png` |
| BLOCKER-3c | "My Categoty" typo category leaked | **PASS** — visible in `/clauses` sidebar | `scripts/screenshots/ux-verify/06-clauses.png` |
| MAJOR-4 | Recent Activity feed noise | **NOTE** — seed-dependent; current fresh seed shows 1 "Contract updated" entry (not 7 as in the earlier walkthrough screenshot). Severity should be revised to MINOR in fresh-seed states; the finding still holds when data accumulates. | `scripts/screenshots/ux-verify/07-dashboard-activity.png` |
| MAJOR-5 | `Upload` + `New Contract` both exist without disambiguation | **PASS** — both buttons present in contracts-list header | `scripts/screenshots/ux-verify/08-contracts-buttons.png` |
| MAJOR-6 | Expiring Soon KPI links to `/contracts` with no filter | **NOTE** — click routed to a specific contract detail, suggesting the KPI-card Playwright selector hit a recent-activity row instead. Manual re-check against the `DashboardPage.tsx` `cards[]` config confirms `Expiring Soon` → `to: '/contracts'` with no `?expiryDateTo=` query. Finding stands. | code: `apps/web/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx:87-92` |
| MAJOR-7 | Counterparties table has no `# Contracts` column | **PASS** — headers are `NAME / EMAIL / WEBSITE / ADDED`, no contracts count | `scripts/screenshots/ux-verify/10-counterparties.png` |

**Net result: 8 of 10 top findings PASS live verification; 2 are NOTEs (1 seed-dependent, 1 selector issue with the finding still confirmed by code).** No finding was contradicted.

Running the verifier yourself:

```
E2E_PASSWORD=password123 node scripts/ux-verify-findings.mjs
```

Output is written to stdout and screenshots to `scripts/screenshots/ux-verify/`.

## Appendix B — B.6 execution log (2026-04-23 → 2026-04-24)

After the review was written, we executed a tightly-scoped improvement
sprint — one fix per commit, JTBD + market-reference framing per item,
Playwright verify script + screenshots per commit. Per the user's
direction we skipped the "unify AI entry points" work and kept two
distinct affordances (ChatPanel on the right for conversation, ⌘K
palette on detail pages for contract-scoped questions).

| # | Sub-commit | Severity cleared | Landed |
|---|---|---|---|
| B.6.1 | `clean-demo` script — removes test artefacts + de-dupes categories/clauses/templates | **BLOCKER ×2** (test data visible in customer-facing areas) | ✅ |
| B.6.2 | `ComingSoonPage` for `/analytics` + `/signatures` with notify-me + back-to-dashboard | **BLOCKER ×1** (orphan routes) | ✅ |
| B.6.3 | Unify AI entry points | **BLOCKER ×1** — **SKIPPED** per user call (separate JTBDs kept) | ⏭ |
| B.6.4 | Activity feed rewritten Linear-style (actor avatar + verb + entity + relative time; System noise hidden) | **MAJOR ×1** | ✅ |
| B.6.5 | Expiring Soon deep-link with URL-seeded filter + dismissable chip | **MAJOR ×1** | ✅ |
| B.6.6 | Dashboard Quick Actions open modals in place (Gmail-compose pattern) | **MAJOR ×1** | ✅ |
| B.6.7 | Contracts header: `Upload PDF` + `Draft new` (disambiguated labels) | **MAJOR ×1** | ✅ |
| B.6.8 | Placeholder "Unnamed Contract" titles fall back to filename — 3-layer fix (agent reject, client render, backfill) | **MAJOR ×1** | ✅ |
| B.6.9 | Counterparties gains `# Contracts` + `Last activity` columns + clickable rows with drill-through filter chip | **MAJOR ×2** | ✅ |
| B.6.10 | Login page gains SSO buttons (Google / Microsoft / SAML) + Forgot password | **MAJOR ×2** | ✅ |
| B.6.11 | `UserPicker` type-ahead replaces raw user-ID input + `<select>` across DecisionStrip + ApprovalCard | **MAJOR ×1** | ✅ |
| B.6.12 | Contract-detail header collapses gracefully at <1280px via Actions menu | **MAJOR ×1** | ✅ |
| B.6.13 | Logo-as-link → `/dashboard` (screen-reader labelled) | **MINOR ×1** | ✅ |
| B.6.14 | Register: strength meter + confirm field + Terms / Privacy checkbox | **MAJOR ×2** | ✅ |
| B.6.15 | "Your day" band on dashboard — per-user pending work above org KPIs | **MINOR ×1** → DELIGHT | ✅ |
| B.6.16 | Requests tabs show per-status counts + explainer paragraph | **MAJOR ×1**, **MINOR ×1** | ✅ |
| B.6.17 | Row-level `Retry` button on Failed contracts in the list | **MAJOR ×1** | ✅ |
| B.6.18 | Clause Library `New clause` button always visible + empty-state button | **MAJOR ×2** | ✅ |
| B.6.19 | Playbook empty state: explainer paragraph + ghost preview of the 4 position types | **MAJOR ×2** | ✅ |
| B.6.20 | Logout / 401 → `/login?next=<url>` preserves destination | **MAJOR ×1** | ✅ |
| B.6.21 | Approvals warns when zero workflows defined (silent-failure prevention) | **MINOR ×1** → elevated | ✅ |
| B.6.22 | Admin Roles flags unconfigured roles + optional hide toggle | **MAJOR ×1** | ✅ |
| B.6.23 | Profile: initials-avatar preview + helpful URL copy (upload lands v1.1) | **MINOR ×2** | ✅ |
| B.6.24 | Organization: native color picker + logo preview | **MINOR ×2** | ✅ |
| B.6.25 | **New**: Global search palette `⌘/` in header — contracts / counterparties / templates / clauses / requests | **MAJOR ×1** (no global search) | ✅ |
| B.6.26 | **New**: Breadcrumbs on every non-root page | **MAJOR ×1** | ✅ |
| B.6.27 | **New**: Toast system for mutation feedback (wired into Profile + Organization as starter) | **MAJOR ×1** (inconsistent mutation feedback) | ✅ |

### Net result

- **All 5 BLOCKERs cleared** (4 fixed, 1 superseded by user decision to keep two AI entry points)
- **~18 of 39 MAJORs cleared** directly; several more partially addressed (error handling, empty states)
- **~12 of 44 MINORs cleared**
- **3 new DELIGHT additions**: global search, Your-day band, Linear-style activity feed
- **27 verify scripts** committed (`scripts/b61-verify.mjs` through `scripts/b627-verify.mjs`) — every change has a Playwright regression check
- **~120 screenshots** committed under `scripts/screenshots/b6/`

### Updated category scores (my estimate)

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Contract detail UX | 9 / 10 | 9 / 10 (unchanged — already strong) |
| Core loops | 7 / 10 | **9 / 10** (upload → review → approve improved end-to-end) |
| Secondary pages | 5 / 10 | **8 / 10** (Templates/Clauses/Playbook/Requests all upgraded) |
| Admin / Settings | 7 / 10 | **8 / 10** |
| Navigation + shell | 4 / 10 | **8 / 10** (global search + breadcrumbs + logo-link fixed the core gaps) |
| Onboarding | 6 / 10 | **7 / 10** |
| Polish / data quality | 3 / 10 | **9 / 10** (test data gone; consistent visual language) |
| **OVERALL** | **6.5 / 10** | **~8.5 / 10** |

### What remains for v1.1

From the original review:
- Real file uploads for logo + avatar (currently URL-only with v1.1 note in-UI)
- Password-reset email flow (UI stub + admin-reset fallback shipped today)
- Real OIDC / SAML handlers behind the SSO buttons
- Signature capture (A.4)
- Analytics dashboard (the `/analytics` route now has a proper "Launching in v1.1" placeholder with notify-me)
- Mobile hamburger navigation
- Write-mode AI actions in the ⌘K palette (currently "coming soon" for write)
- Bulk actions on the contracts list

None of these are blocking a first customer demo.
