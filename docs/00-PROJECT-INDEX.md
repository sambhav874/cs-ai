# CLM Platform — Project Index

## What This Is

This is the complete engineering specification for a **New Age, Agent-First Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) platform**. The platform combines LLM-powered agents that execute contract workflows with contextual visual UI surfaces for oversight, configuration, and collaboration.

These docs complement the `CLM_Complete_Product_Specification.xlsx` which contains the feature registry (75+ features), screen specifications (20+ screens), agent conversation flows, and navigation structure. **This doc set is the engineering blueprint for building it.**

## How To Use These Docs

**Read in order for the first time.** Then reference individual files as you build each phase.

1. Start with **Architecture** docs (01–07) to understand the system design, tech stack, data model, agent framework, and design system.
2. Build **Phase by Phase** (08–17). Each phase is self-contained and testable. Don't skip phases — each builds on the previous.
3. Reference **Operations** docs (18–19) for testing and deployment at each phase.

## Cross-Reference System

Every feature, screen, and flow has a unique ID that is consistent across the Excel spec and these docs:

- **Features**: `IN-001` (Intake), `DR-001` (Draft), `NG-001` (Negotiate), `AP-001` (Approve), `EX-001` (Execute), `PS-001` (Post-Sig), `SR-001` (Search), `AN-001` (Analytics), `CL-001` (Collab), `CFG-001` (Config), `AD-001` (Admin), `INT-001` (Integration)
- **Screens**: `SCR-001` through `SCR-045`
- **Agent Flows**: `CHAT-001` through `CHAT-010`
- **Agents**: Intake Agent, Draft Agent, Review Agent, Redline Agent, Approval Agent, Signature Agent, Obligation Agent, Invoice Agent, Search Agent, Compliance Agent, Integration Agent, Insight Agent
