/**
 * HTML sanitization (Wave 2.6, 2026-07).
 *
 * Every `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` sink in the app renders HTML that can
 * originate from an untrusted source — counterparty-uploaded contract text,
 * agent/LLM output, org-authored playbook/template content. Before this,
 * those sinks rendered raw HTML with no sanitization, so one crafted upload
 * could execute script in a legal team's browser (and tokens sat in
 * localStorage). Route every sink through `sanitizeHtml`.
