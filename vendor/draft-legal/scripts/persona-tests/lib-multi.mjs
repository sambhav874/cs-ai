/**
 * lib-multi.mjs — multi-turn conversation runner.
 *
 * Each conversation is a list of turns sent on the SAME sessionId so the
 * agent's memory is exercised. Per-turn rubric checks:
 *   • mustMentionAny: at least one of the listed strings appears in reply
 *   • mustMention:    EVERY listed string appears in reply
 *   • expectedTools:  one of the named tools was called this turn (OR
 *                      since stream start if `cumulativeTools` is true)
 *   • contextWords:   reply references a phrase established in earlier turns
 *                     (proves multi-turn context retention)
 *   • maxLatencyMs:   reply lands within budget
 *   • minTurnTokens:  reply is at least N tokens (catches "..." stub replies)
 *   • notHallucinated: reply does NOT include any of the listed strings
 *                     (e.g. "I created" without a tool call = bad)
 *
 * Conversation pass = ALL turns pass. One failed turn fails the whole
 * conversation but later turns still run (their failure is informative).

 *
 * Beyond `ok` / `fails`, it reports how the turn passed:
 *
 *   gracefulEmpty   the reply read as an honest "couldn't find that"
 *   suppressed      checks the graceful-empty bypass ATE — each of these
 *                   WOULD have failed had the reply not looked like a refusal

 *                   "no answer" ('not specified'), without the reply reading
 *                   as a refusal — the rubric's own escape hatch
 *   shrugPass       the turn passed AND the reply reads as a decline: green
 *                   without the rubric checking what it was written to check
 *
 * `shrugPass` is REPORTED, never enforced. An honest empty answer genuinely is
 * the right answer on many rows, and flipping those to failures wholesale
 * would be a worse lie in the other direction. What was missing is that
 * nobody could tell how many of the green turns were shrugs — an agent that
 * declined every question scored well and the summary said 'passed'. Now the
 * count is on the scorecard, and tightening individual rows is a decision
 * someone can make with the number in front of them.
