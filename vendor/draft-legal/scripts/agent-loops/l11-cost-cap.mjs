/**
 * L11 — the daily cost cap fails open on every Python-side LLM call.
 *
 * A four-hop chain:
 *
 *   1. aiRouter throws CostCapExceededError when the org is over cap.
 *   2. POST /resolve special-cases only NoProviderAvailable (503) and sends
 *      everything else to `500 Internal error`.
 *   3. router.py calls raise_for_status(), which raises on the 500.
 *   4. `except Exception:` logs a warning and falls through to
 *      _platform_resolve(), which reads the platform key out of the agents
 *      service's own env. THE CALL PROCEEDS.
 *
 * So being over the cap is indistinguishable from "Node is unreachable", and
 * the designed response to that is "bill the platform key anyway".
 *
 * The same fallback silently defeats BYOK: an org with its own key that hits
 * ANY /resolve failure gets the platform key, so we pay and their tier override
 * is ignored. The docstring in router.py shows the author reasoned about
 * exactly this — "which is precisely the BYOK bypass, wearing a different hat"
 * — but guarded only the case where the URL/secret are unset, not the case
 * where the call fails.
 *
 * The Node proxy gates /agent/chat per HTTP request, which is why nobody
 * noticed. But one turn is up to seven LLM calls.
 *
 * Run BEFORE: over-cap resolves as 500, and the Python router bills the
 *             platform key anyway.
 * Run AFTER:  over-cap is a distinct status the router refuses to paper over.
