/**
 * L13 — dead names, and one dead code path that blocks the event loop.
 *
 * `matter_get` is phantom in THREE independent places: a PER_TOOL_BUDGET entry
 * documented twice, and a branch in each web client. There is no tool file, no
 * registry entry and no endpoint. Three layers agree on a capability that has
 * never existed — the budget can never be hit and the branches never match.
 *
 * `draft_clause` is phantom in one: a branch in artifact-from-tool.ts. Runtime
 * impact nil; the cost is that it reads as a supported capability, so an
 * engineer adding clause drafting will assume the artifact path is wired. That
 * same file carries the receipt for this exact bug class — "Audit 2026-06-10:
 * dropped the save_draft / send_for_review pseudo-tool buttons" — and
 * draft_clause survived that cleanup.
 *
 * The legacy non-agentMode path is worse than stale. `graph.invoke(...)` is
 * synchronous inside `async def run_chat`, awaited with no threadpool, and
 * `general_respond` is a plain `def` whose `llm.invoke(...)` blocks for the
 * whole model round-trip. One such request stalls the entire uvicorn worker for
 * 5-30 seconds — every concurrent chat, tool callback and health check behind
 * it. It is latent only because both web surfaces send agentMode: true, while
 * agents.ts defaults it to FALSE, so any direct caller, probe or eval script
 * that omits the flag trips it.
 *
 * Run BEFORE: three phantom matter_get references, one draft_clause, and a
 *             blocking call on the legacy path.
 * Run AFTER:  the phantoms are gone and the blocking call is off the loop.
