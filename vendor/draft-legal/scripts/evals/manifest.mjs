/**
 * The eval suite's inventory — ADR-01, docs/37.
 *
 * One place that says what every check is, what it needs to run, and which tier
 * it belongs to. Tiers are defined by COST AND DETERMINISM, not by subject:
 *
 *   t1  static analysis only. No services, no database, no model. $0, ~seconds.
 *       Blocking on every PR, including PRs from forks (which cannot see repo
 *       secrets — see docs/37 E9).
 *   t2  needs Postgres/Redis/the API, but makes NO model call. Deterministic.
 *       Blocking on every PR once CI stands up the services (ci.yml already
 *       runs pgvector + redis for test-api).
 *   t3  makes real model calls. Costs money, varies run to run. NIGHTLY on
 *       main, never blocking a PR.
 *
 * `needs` is not documentation — run.mjs checks each precondition before
 * running a check and SKIPS loudly if unmet. A skipped check is never counted
 * as a pass; that is the difference between this and the step it replaces
 * (`pytest tests/ ... || true`, which reported success for a directory that did
 * not exist).
 *
 * Classification was done by reading each file's imports and call sites, not by
 * grepping: a naive probe for `login()`/`API}` misfiles the Playwright check as
 * static and l7-prompt-truth as stack-dependent. If you add a check, add it
 * here — run.mjs fails on any check file that is not listed.

  // the strength of running 9/9 with the agents service stopped and no valid
  // model key. That evidence was wrong twice:
  //
  //   1. Section 3 (`over-cap resolve is refused with 429`, :116) only reaches
  //      the cap when the API holds a PLATFORM key: aiRouter.ts:191 calls
  //      assertCostCapNotExceeded inside `if (platKey)`, so with no key the
  //      loop falls through to NoProviderAvailable → 503, and the assertion
  //      fails. It passed locally only because aiRouter.ts:85's
  //      PLACEHOLDER_VALUES filters exact sentinels ('', 'REPLACE', 'unset'),
  //      so a junk 10-char key still counted as present. t2 is DEFINED as
  //      keyless (README.md), so this cannot live there.
  //   2. Its cap-cache invalidation (:98-103) shells out to
  //      `docker exec clm_redis` — the compose container_name. A GitHub
  //      Actions services: container is not named that, the DEL silently
  //      no-ops into `catch {}`, and the check races costCap.ts's 30s TTL.
  //      t2 is defined by determinism; that is not deterministic in CI.
  //
  // Splitting the static 8 into their own t1 check is the real win here, and
  // is a task rather than a manifest edit.
