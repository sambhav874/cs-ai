# Agent eval suite

Runs the checks in `manifest.mjs` by tier and produces an exit code CI gates on.
Design and reasoning: `docs/37-AGENT-EVAL-PLAN.md`, ADR-01.

```bash
node scripts/evals/run.mjs --tier t1                    # static, free, no services
node scripts/evals/run.mjs --tier t1,t2                 # + stack, still no model
node scripts/evals/run.mjs --tier t1 --check-baseline    # fail on regression or coverage loss
node scripts/evals/run.mjs --tier t1 --baseline          # accept the current state
```

## Tiers — cost and determinism, not subject

| | Needs | Cost | Runs | Checks | Assertions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **t1** | nothing | $0 | blocking, every PR (incl. forks) | 6 | 97 *(measured 2026-08-17)* |
| **t2** | Postgres, Redis, API, web, Chromium, venv, replay | $0 | blocking, every PR | 14 | **218** *(measured in CI 2026-08-29)* |
| **t3** | all of the above + a model key | real money | nightly on `main`, never a PR | 17 + 3 suites | ~274 *(derived)* |

Counts are cumulative — `--tier t1,t2` runs 14 checks. t1 and t2 are now both
MEASURED: t2's 218 came from the first green CI run of `agent-evals-t2`, which
is also the first time the full stack has been stood up anywhere. t3 remains
derived, because nothing has ever run it.

t1 and t2 need **no API key**, which is what makes them safe to block fork PRs
on — this repo is public, and forks cannot read secrets.

A t2 check may stub the model rather than replay it. `l15-empty-turn` drives
`run_agent_chat_stream` with a stub LLM and `needs: ['venv']` only — no
database, no API, no key — which is how model-response HANDLING gets tested on
every PR while the model itself stays out of the loop.

**Tier 2 now has a CI job** — `agent-evals-t2` in `ci.yml`. It stands up
Postgres, Redis, the API, the web dev server, Chromium, a Python venv and the
agents service in replay mode, then runs `--tier t1,t2 --strict`. It does **not**
pass `--check-baseline`: the baseline file holds t1 only, and t2 counts have to
come from a real run rather than arithmetic. Once the job is green on `main`:

```bash
node scripts/evals/run.mjs --tier t1,t2 --baseline-path scripts/evals/baseline-t2.json --baseline
```

commit that file and add `--baseline-path … --check-baseline` to the job. Until
then t2 gates on pass/fail and on skips; t1 keeps the coverage-loss gate.

**The nightly t3 workflow is still not enabled**, and would fail on first
dispatch: `.github/workflows/nightly-evals.yml` has no `services:`, no install
and no service boot, so every check skips and `--strict` turns that into exit 1.
The `agent-evals-t2` job is the pattern to copy when building it. Treat t3 as
"run it by hand on a booted stack" until then.

## Running t2 locally will leave data behind

`l4-draft-tenancy` performs 11 Prisma writes and has **no cleanup block**. That
is fine in CI, where the database is created and thrown away per job, and it is
not fine against your dev database, where the rows persist and the next run
starts from different state.

Four t2 checks are read-only and safe to run against a dev stack any time:

```bash
node scripts/agent-loops/l5-redline-reach.mjs     # 13 assertions
node scripts/agent-loops/l15-empty-turn.mjs       # 16
node scripts/agent-loops/l7-prompt-truth.mjs      # 15
node scripts/agent-loops/e8-eval-identity.mjs     #  9
```

`l6b-dead-controls` writes but restores in `finally`. `l4-draft-tenancy` does
not — prefer CI, or expect to clean up after it.

## What the suite still does not measure

Three gaps worth knowing before quoting any number from it. Full analysis in
`docs/38-EVAL-GAPS.md`.

**Nothing checks whether an answer is true.** Grading is substring matching over
the reply text (`scripts/persona-tests/lib.mjs`, `lib-multi.mjs`). There is no
groundedness or citation-accuracy dimension anywhere, so a confident wrong
number passes as long as the right words appear.

**A refusal passes most rows.** `gracefulEmptyOk` defaults true and no case sets
it false, so "I couldn't find that" suppresses `mustMentionAny`, `contextWords`
and `minReplyChars`; 53 of 91 `mustMentionAny` lists also carry a phrase only a
refusal matches. This is defensible — an honest empty answer often IS correct —
but it used to be invisible. The runner now prints **shrug passes** beside the
pass count:

```
Persona journeys: 52/66 passed
  of which passed on a shrug: 14/52 (27%)
```

Read the two together. If shrugs climb while the pass rate holds, the agent is
getting more evasive and the headline cannot see it. `e14-grader-truth` (t1)
keeps that accounting honest and is mutation-proven.

**Under-retrieval is invisible.** No expected record sets exist, so a query that
should return 15 contracts and returns 3 passes every rubric. Production has the
same blind spot; `scripts/production-health.mjs` says so out loud rather than
implying coverage.

## What a green t2 does NOT mean

**t2 replays the model.** It answers *"does our code do the right thing given
what the model said"* — tool dispatch, the confirm gate, RBAC, error surfacing,
memory replay. That is most of the agent, and it is where every defect in
`docs/36` actually lived.

It is **blind to prompt regressions by construction.** If you edit
`AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` and the model would now choose a different tool, t2 will
not notice: it is serving a recording made before your edit. That is t3's job.
**Do not read a green t2 as "the prompt is fine."**

## Replay

```bash
AGENT_REPLAY_MODE=record  # capture real responses to apps/agents/evals/replay/
AGENT_REPLAY_MODE=replay  # serve them back; no key, no network, no cost
```

Fixtures are keyed on `(session_id, call_index)` — deliberately **not** a hash
of the messages. The system prompt is in every message list, so hashing would
invalidate every fixture on a one-line prompt edit and make replay annoying
enough that people stop using it. Call-order keying survives prompt edits while
still catching the code making a different *number or order* of model calls.

Use a stable `sessionId` (`replay:<case-name>`). The tools are **not** stubbed —
a replayed turn still hits the real database. Only the model is replaced.

A missing fixture is a loud error, never a silent live call.

## Before you push

```bash
node scripts/evals/preflight.mjs              # committed state
node scripts/evals/preflight.mjs --worktree   # include uncommitted edits
```

`git archive HEAD` into a temp dir and runs the suite there: tracked files only,
no `node_modules`, no `.venv`, a different absolute path. **A local pass does not
predict CI**, because your machine has all of those. This suite's first two CI
runs were red for exactly three reasons a local run cannot surface — a static
Prisma import in the shared harness, thirteen checks hardcoding
`/Users/<someone>/…`, and a "tier 1" check shelling out to the Python venv.

`--worktree` overlays uncommitted edits, but only **tracked** ones. A brand new
check file that has not been `git add`ed does not exist as far as preflight is
concerned — it reports the check as MISSING and fails, which is correct and is
exactly what CI would do. `git add` it first.

## Preconditions are facts, not settings

`needs` entries are probed, and each probe asserts the fact the manifest reads
it as — not a weaker one nearby. Four of them used to assert the weaker version,
and all four reported "fine" when they could not check:

| probe | asserted | should assert |
|---|---|---|
| `db` | `DATABASE_URL` is set | a database answers on that host/port |
| `playwright` | `node_modules/playwright` exists | a browser binary exists |
| `model` | a key string is non-empty | it is long enough to be a real key |
| `personas` | a login succeeds | …as the address the seeder actually creates |

The `model` one bites hardest: `router.py`'s `_platform_resolve` takes the FIRST
provider in the tier list that has a key, so a junk `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` does not
fall through to a working one — it captures resolution and 401s every case,
which reads exactly like a model regression.

If you add a `needs` entry, probe the thing itself. A precondition that can only
ever answer one way hides the suite it guards.

## Adding a check

1. Write it in `scripts/agent-loops/` using the shared harness (`check`,
   `section`, `report`).
2. Add it to `manifest.mjs` with a tier and its `needs`. An unlisted check
   **fails the run** — a check nothing runs is the failure mode this suite
   exists to end.
3. **Watch it fail before you trust it.** Across `docs/36`, thirty-eight
   assertions passed against broken code — about one in seven — and none were
   caught by review or CI. Reverting the fix is the only thing that ever caught
   them.
4. Re-baseline: `--baseline`.

`needs` is enforced, not documentation: an unmet precondition SKIPS loudly. A
skip is never a pass — "could not check" and "checked and fine" must not share
an exit code.
