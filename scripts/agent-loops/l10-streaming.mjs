/**
 * L10 — the stream is fake, and the proxy corrupts what it carries.
 *
 * orchestrator.py passed streaming=False to resolve_llm, awaited the whole
 * answer with ainvoke, then split the finished string on ' ' and yielded one
 * `token` event per word WITH NO SLEEP. The in-code admission was verbatim:
 * "Word-by-word 'stream' to match the existing UX. Real token streaming lands
 * when we add .astream_events() in a follow-up." Because there was no sleep
 * between yields, the typewriter was a single burst -- the fake-streaming code
 * bought nothing at all over sending one frame. routes/assist.py already had a
 * real llm.astream; the agent chat path just didn't use it.
 *
 * Two transport defects sat on top.
 *
 * agents.ts called `decoder.decode(value)` WITHOUT { stream: true }, while a
 * different handler in the same file got it right and both web clients pass
 * the flag -- an isolated omission, not house style. With 20 000-char tool
 * payloads, frames routinely span TCP segments, and any chunk boundary landing
 * inside a UTF-8 sequence produced U+FFFD in place of an em-dash, curly quote,
 * ellipsis, bullet or currency symbol. Contract text is dense with all five.
 * It is intermittent and load-dependent, so it reads as a model quality
 * problem rather than a proxy bug.
 *
 * And the proxy dropped the X-Accel-Buffering: no header Python set, so behind
 * nginx or an ALB the whole SSE response can be buffered into one write.
 *
 * Run BEFORE: every token frame arrives in one burst after a long silence; a
 *             multibyte-dense payload comes back through the proxy carrying
 *             U+FFFD; X-Accel-Buffering is absent.
 * Run AFTER:  tokens spread across the generation window, bytes survive the
 *             proxy intact, and the buffering hint is forwarded.
