/**
 * L8 — the rail misreports what the agent did.
 *
 * Three misreports in one envelope:
 *
 *  (a) A write proposal's chip spins forever, in the RAIL only. tool_call_start
 *      creates the chip; the awaiting-confirmation branch then `continue`s, so
 *      no tool_call_result ever arrives for that id, and nothing outside the
 *      result branch mutates a chip's status. The chip stays 'running' for the
 *      life of the thread — next to an Apply card that is waiting on the USER.
 *      AgentHomePage gets this right.
 *
 *  (b) A failed tool renders a GREEN chip on /agent only, which sets
 *      status 'ok' unconditionally without inspecting the result.
 *
 *  (c) `unknown_tool` produces no log line anywhere. `tool_raised` at least
 *      gets a logger.exception.
 *
 * Underneath all three: the envelope carries no success/failure field, so each
 * client invents one. The rail substring-sniffs for `"error"` in up to 20 KB of
 * tool JSON — a search result containing `"errors": []`, or contract text using
 * the word, renders as a failed tool.
 *
 * And platform-generated errors are wrapped in <<<UNTRUSTED_TOOL_DATA>>>, whose
 * prompt definition is "derived from user/counterparty documents". The agent is
 * being told to distrust its own runtime's error reports.
 *
 * These are static assertions on code shape. The rendering itself is a browser
 * concern, but the defects here are all "which field does this read" — checkable
 * exactly, and cheaper to keep honest than a screenshot.
 *
 * Run BEFORE: no ok field on the envelope, both clients deriving status their
 *             own way, the rail never closing out a proposal chip, and
 *             unknown_tool silent.
 * Run AFTER:  one authoritative field, both clients reading it, the chip
 *             resolved, and the failure logged.
