/**
 * L12 — session memory grows without bound, and truncates the wrong tools.
 *
 * memory.py trimmed to the last 50 MESSAGES, which is not a size bound. Tool
 * results persist at up to 20_000 chars each for most tools, and the restore
 * loop replays every one of them into the next prompt with no cap. Worst case
 * is 25 tool calls x 20 KB x 25 assistant turns -- megabytes re-sent on EVERY
 * subsequent message, so cost grows quadratically in turn count. Long before
 * the wallet notices, it exceeds the context window and 400s, which L3 then
 * swallowed into a blank bubble.
 *
 * The comment claiming the persisted slice was capped "at the same preview
 * (<=2000 chars typically)" was true before the 20K allowlist was added
 * immediately above it. Being off by 10x is exactly why this was invisible in
 * review.
 *
 * THE MIRROR DEFECT (sections 4-5). A8 tells the model the whole prior listing
 * is still in history, so "quote the second match" is answerable without
 * re-running the search. That promise held only for the three tools A8 names,
 * because all three sit in the 20K streaming allowlist and the persisted slice
 * was taken FROM the streamed preview. Every tool off that allowlist streamed
 * at 800, so `preview[:2000]` could never exceed 800 either. clause_search
 * defaults to 5 x 400-char windows -- roughly 3 KB -- so 800 chars cut it
 * mid-token on a routine call, and the next turn quoted a fragment or silently
 * re-ran the search and returned a DIFFERENT match. That contradiction is the
 * exact failure A8 exists to prevent.
 *
 * Run BEFORE: only a message-count trim, and the persisted slice is whatever
 *             the streamed preview was (up to 20K -- or, for the tools that
 *             matter here, capped at 800).
 * Run AFTER:  a byte ceiling on the log, and a separate cap on what is
 *             persisted for replay, decoupled from the stream cap.
