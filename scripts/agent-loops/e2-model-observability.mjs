/**
 * E2/E3 — which model answered, and whether a pin is honoured.
 *
 * The `done` frame carried only `session_id`. agents.ts:236-240 states the
 * problem in its own comment: "the SSE stream doesn't echo the resolved pair
 * back." So when an eval case flips you cannot tell a prompt regression from a
 * model swap from a key rotation, and a baseline is uninterpretable.
 *
 * It is not merely unrecorded, it is UNSTABLE. router.py's _platform_resolve
 * returns the first provider in the tier list that has an env key, ordered
 * anthropic → openai → google → openrouter. The identical case resolves to a
 * different model in CI than on a dev box — so adding a secret to the repo
 * silently changes every eval result. All four fields already exist on
 * ResolvedLlm; they were simply thrown away.
 *
 * E3 is the matching client-side bug. scripts/persona-tests/lib-multi.mjs asks
 * for `provider: 'openai', modelId: 'gpt-4.1-mini'`, but askAgent's destructured
 * signature never accepted either and its request body never carried them, so
 * 66 committed conversations ran on org defaults while the report attributes
 * their cost and latency to gpt-4.1-mini.
 *
 * Run BEFORE: the done frame has one field, and a pin is silently discarded.
 * Run AFTER:  provider/model/tier/source are reported, and a pin is honoured.
