/**
 * E14 — the multi-turn grader tells the truth about HOW a turn passed.
 *
 * `lib-multi.mjs` grades 152 asks and its most permissive path is one regex.
 * `gracefulEmptyOk` defaults to true and NO case in the corpus sets it false,
 * so any reply reading like "I couldn't find that" suppresses mustMentionAny,
 * contextWords and minReplyChars. Separately, 53 of the 91 mustMentionAny
 * lists carry a phrase that only matches when the agent declined — 'no
 * carrier', 'not specified' — so on those rows a refusal satisfies the rubric
 * outright, without the regex being involved at all.
 *
 * Both behaviours are DEFENSIBLE: an honest empty answer is the correct answer
 * on a lot of these rows, and penalising it would push the agent toward
 * confident guessing, which is the worse failure in a contract product. What
 * was not defensible is that neither was visible. An agent that declined every
 * question scored well and the summary line said "passed", with nothing
 * anywhere reporting how much of the green was shrugs.
 *
 * So the grader now reports `shrugPass` per turn, and this check is what keeps
 * that honest. It drives scoreMultiTurn directly with synthetic replies — no
 * model, no stack, no key — which is the only way to watch a grader fail
 * without buying a model call to do it.
 *
 * Run BEFORE (2026-08-17): scoreMultiTurn did not exist; the rubric was inline
 *             in runConversation and reachable only through a live model call.
 * Run AFTER:  every bypass the rubric takes is named in `suppressed`, and a
 *             turn that went green without being examined is `shrugPass`.
