/**
 * L5 — the agent cannot reach the redlining feature that shipped last week.
 *
 * Five phases built full-document playbook redlining with a tracked-changes
 * Word export (docs/35, in production 2026-08-08). None of it is reachable by
 * asking.
 *
 * The sharpest part is not the missing capability, it is the DISHONESTY.
 * `redline_propose.py` shipped this string to the model:
 *
 *     "Read-only — use redline_apply to turn a chosen variant into a new
 *      ContractVersion."
 *
 * There is no such tool. So the only place the model is told the verb exists is
 * a description pointing at a tool it cannot call, and the prompt's
 * "never claim the change was made" rule covers only comment_add,
 * contract_update and request_create. Nothing stops the model announcing it
 * applied a variant it never applied — the exact failure this codebase already
 * documents for drafting ("the agent fell into a loop hallucinating 'I created
 * the draft' without ever calling a tool that produced one").
 *
 * Section 1 generalises that into an invariant, because the class matters more
 * than the instance: no tool description may name a tool that is not
 * registered.
 *
 * Run BEFORE: redline_propose points the model at a tool that does not exist,
 *             and no redline_apply is registered.
 * Run AFTER:  every named tool is real, redline_apply is a confirm-gated write
 *             tool, and the Node layers that were already finished are wired.
